# PHP Deployment

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rolfdenhartog/php-deploy.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/rolfdenhartog/php-deploy)

## This package is still being developed!

A set of commands to:

* Pull the code from Bitbucket or Github.
* Deploy a website to a production environment.
* Perform a rollback of your production environment.

This package does not:

* Connect to a server via SSH.
* Deploy code on multiple servers.

If you want to do one of the things above, I suggest [Rocketeer](http://rocketeer.autopergamene.eu/).

This package was created to provide a set of simple but helpful commands to deploy code on a single server running PHP.

## Requirements

* PHP 5.6.*
* Git installed on your server

## Before installation

Before you can install this tool, you need to have the following ready:

* Git repositories set up on the server.
* Git repositories are able to download the code with SSH/public key (the `git pull` command shouldn't need a password).
* Webhooks configured on Bitbucket or Github.
* A virtual host set up to receive a webhook.

It is a best practice to create a subdomain for the webhook. Something like deploy.example.org. It is even better to use
a name like deploy-29c37h3a92.example.org. This makes it much harder for hackers to guess the domain name.

## Installation

```
composer require rolfdenhartog/php-deploy
```

Once composer installed this package, you need to run the following command to start:

```
php vendor/bin/php-deploy init
```

This will copy a few files to your project directory.

**`php-deploy-configuration.php`**

If you open this file, you will see that it is simply returning an array. The array is the complete configuration this
package will need. In the copied file you will find doc blocks telling you how to configure.

**`webhook-bitbucket.php`**

This file is able to receive webhooks from Bitbucket. If you do not use Bitbucket, you can simply delete this file.

**`webhook-github.php`**

This file is able to receive webhooks from Github. If you do not use Github, you can simply delete this file.

## Commands

To see all the possible commands, simply run `php vendor/bin/php-deploy` in the same directory where you have your
composer.json file.

### `pull`

If you want to pull code manually, you can use this command. 

```
php vendor/bin/php-deploy pull username/repository branch
```

You can run code after this command be using the custom git hook `post-pull`. Simply create a file in the `.git/hooks`
directory. Don't forget to make the file executable and add the interpreter. For example: `#!/bin/bash`.

### `release:create`

```
release:create [--dry-run] [--] <repository>
```

This command creates a new release based on the directory in the configuration file (repository > deployment > from). A
new directory with a timestamp is created and the files are copied to this directory. Use the `--dry-run` option to run
the command without any files changed, but only to see the output of the command.

### `release:rollback`

```
release:rollback [--dry-run] [--] <repository>
```

You can also perform a rollback on your production environment. Use the `--dry-run` option to only see the output with
anything changed. Be aware that a release with be deleted and cannot be undone.

## To do

* [ ] Add Gitlab support
* [ ] Add option `--delete` to the `release:rollback` command: make it optional to delete a release directory. Otherwise
it should simply change the symlink.
